## Introduction

A school project of a train configuration editor.

This course project had been made for Alstom, as a partnership. We got no idea if they ever did something with it (I guess probably not, it was just a class project).

I mainly worked on the need analysis and the conception. I wrote most of the reports and draw most of the UML diagrams.
